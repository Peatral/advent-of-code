# Advent of Code 2022

### FAQ
- **Why JavaScript?**<br>
Because I am thought I don't wanna use Java this year...
- **Why not start with day 0 and go to day 24?**<br>
Because it confused the heck out of me last year.

## Stuff
Every day is in its own folder and has its own npm script. In the folder of each day is an `index.js` file containing the code, a `README.md` file containing the infos about this day and a `input.txt` file containing my specific inputs.
