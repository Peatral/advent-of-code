# Advent of Code 2021

### FAQ
- **Why Java?**<br>
Because I am familiar with it...
- **Why start with day 0 and go to day 24?**<br>
Because this is java, not lua. Also, I am german, to me christmas is on the 24th. That is when I open my presents. The 25th is just another x on the calender.

## Stuff
Every day is in its own package, I didn't split them into separate modules. 
The inputs for every day are in the resource folder, I use a custom utility 
class to read them.
